# Description
This is the project implementation for the Artificial Intelligent System: Intelligent Models, which simulates the formation of a social Graph.
# Requirements
The required python library are the following:
`networkx`
`plotly`
The project is implemented with `python 3.12`
# Running the program
After installing all the packages the program can be executed by directly running the `main.py`.
If you want to load a previously formed graph you can specify the `--input` argument.

Example to run a new simulation: `path/main.py --n=300 --k=1200 --c=0.5`
Example command to load previous graph: `path/main.py --input=graph_150_800_100.csv`
